Ugh, this was tricky to figure out again, but this is the one!

(1) Open 4NT shell

(2) Copy *.asm files to thingm directory.
Main directory is mapped to A: drive.
Thingm subdirectory is mapped to C: drive.

(3) Make DOS shell fullscreen via ALT+ENTER before invoking.

(4) Invoke cpm.exe, and press keys past nag screen.
You will be congratulated when you're successfully in at A0> prompt.
Read the instructions about 'import' and 'export' commands.

(5) Change to C: drive, import the new ASM file, and run MAC.
        A0> c:
        C0> import thseq242.asm
        C0> dir
        C0> mac thseq242.asm
        C0> dir
        C0> export thseq242.hex
        C0> quit
